Grubbsâ€™s test:
With box plots we observed some data points with high and low values in the data set, for futher analysis we conducted the grubs statitical test
The Grubbs test allows to detect whether the highest or lowest value in a dataset is an outlier.
The Grubbs test detects one outlier at a time (highest or lowest value),
so the null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:
H0: The highest value is not an outlier
H1: The highest value is an outlier
if we want to test the highest value, or: 
H0: The lowest value is not an outlier
H1: The lowest value is an outlier if we want to test the lowest value.

As for any statistical test, if the p-value is less than the chosen significance threshold (generally alpha = 0.10 ) then the null hypothesis is rejected and we will conclude that the lowest/highest value is an outlier. On the contrary, if the p-value is greater or equal than the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected, and we will conclude that, based on the data, we do not reject the hypothesis that the lowest/highest value is not an outlier.
